CodeBook for Tidy UCI HAR Dataset
=================================

This code book describes the tidy dataset produced by the run_analysis.R script. 

The script creates a tidy and condensed version of the UCI's dataset for Human Activity Recognition  based on the accelerometer and gyroscope data from smart phones.

# Raw Data

As stated in http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones, the experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

# Tidy Data

The tidy dataset is contained in the file ```tidy.txt``` produces by calling ```source('run_analysis.R'). The tidy dataset contains 10299 observations with 82 variables.

# Description of the tidy data variables

Each observations in the tidy dataset contains the following variables are provides:


## subject.id
A numeric identifier (1-30) of the subject who carried out the experiment

##activity.id 
A numeric identifier (1-6) of the activity carried out by the subject identified by subject.id

The following list describes the identifier:

- 1 WALKING
- 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- 4 SITTING
- 5 STANDING
- 6 LAYING


##activity.description 
A textual description of the activity

## Measurement Variables

The variables listes below contain the average values for each subject and each activity of the raw data. The naming has been modified from the variables in the raw data according to the following rules:

- parenthesis have been removed
- the abbreviation "Acc" has been replaced with "-acceleration"
- the abbreviation "Mag" has been replaced with "-magnitude"
- all time-based variables are suffixed with "-time" (instead of a "t"-prefix)
- all variables in the frequency domain are suffixed with "-frequency" (instead of a "f"-prefix)
- a broken naming with doubles "BodyBody" has been fixed
- all variables names are converted to lower-case
